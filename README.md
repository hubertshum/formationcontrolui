# AI UAV Flight Simulator

Model the flight of a UAV formation tasked with tracking and surrounding a remote target.

This application visualizes the flight paths of UAVs in a hemispherical formation as they track toward a target. It is built on top of a new AI formation control algorithm called Flux Guiding. The algorithm is packaged [here](https://gitfront.io/r/johnmatthewhartley/c81e9e54cb2749d718e54ae6517bca517097e1ae/formationplanning/)

The principle idea is that a formation can be led by maximizing the sum of an electric field or flux across its surface generated by a target. Since the field is harmonic the formation will orientate itself toward and track the target.

The algorithm is efficient since only the UAVs on the front face of the formation are required to measure the flux and therefore many followers can be added to the formation without increasing the dimensionality of the problem. Also the algorithm is ideal for applications where the formation must maximally cover the target.
